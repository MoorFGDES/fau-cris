Do Not Use This Fork
=========================

This fork is meant for experimental use only. If you are looking the FAU CRIS Wordpress plug-in, you will find the official release at https://github.com/RRZE-Webteam/fau-cris.

The purpose here is that we want to generate publication lists by field that include top level publications als well as publications associated with projects within the field; see also https://github.com/RRZE-Webteam/fau-cris/issues/317. Referring to the CRIS API, we want to merge the results from *getrelated/Forschungsbereich/123455789/fobe_has_top_publ* with *getrelated/Forschungsbereich/123455789/fobe_proj_publ*.
